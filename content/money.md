Spending Money
==============

The most common use case for spending money on behalf of SR is getting travel/accommodation reimbursements. Firstly you should check that your expenses will be reimbursed, as what we reimburse varies year-on-year. 

Keep the receipts for your expenses, currently we haven't decided on a formal process for reimbursement, email the core team (coreteam[at]).

## In Detail

The treasurer (trustee)[TODO: link to trustee page] has the ultimate control over the budget. However, the core team creates budget proposals every year for a competition, and the trustees either accept or reject it.

### Paying for shipping

We have a payment account with UPS, so it is our preferred method. They send invoices which payments are arranged by the treasurer.
