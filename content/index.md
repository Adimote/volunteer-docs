Volunteer Guide
===============

## Who is Student Robotics?

Student Robotics (SR) is a [charity](sr-charity-page) which provides a completely autonomous, free-to-enter robotics competition for 16-18 year olds annually.

See more on the ['Who are we'](/who_are_we) page.

## What is the volunteer guide?

This guide is intended to be:
- A reference of anything that is expected to be done throughout the typical SR year.
- For prospective or new volunteers who are interested in finding out what we do and how we work.

## How to edit this guide

This guide is hosted on github, anyone can view or edit a page, however you need a github account [(register here)](github-register) to make changes.

Every page has a corresponding .md file on github. To edit it, find the page of the same name in [the git repository](volunteer-docs-git-repo), and click the pencil. Once your edit is made, you can save your edit as a 'pull request' (an edit suggestion). Write in the comment box what you've changed and why, then create the request. We will then check it, and either accept or request extra changes.

### Writing Style

Try to keep the guide in an informal and friendly writing style to make it easy to read, similar [to the style at gov.uk][gov-uk-style-guide].

Everything written in this guide should have two layers:
1. A basic summary intended for new volunteers to get a bare minimum understanding of what happens, when, and why.
2. A detailed description of the tasks, aimed at a volunteer intending to carry out and co-ordinate the subject.
