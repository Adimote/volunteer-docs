What is Student Robotics?
=========================

## What do we do?

The tasks we do have a huge variety:
- Make the competition happen.
- Provide mentoring and technical help for schools.
- Maintain & develop kits, and other software.

## How are we organised?

Student Robotics currently has a few groups who run the show:
- The *Trustees*, who handle long term goals and the direction of the charity.
- The *Core Team*, who are responsible for running the competition every year.

The Trustees are more permanent positions, whilst the core team is disbanded and reformed annually.
