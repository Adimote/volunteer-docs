Shepherding
=============

A Shepherd is a volunteer at the competition who ensures teams make it to the arena at their correct timeslots.

We run on a tight schedule during the competition, the schedule doesn't have a pause button. So it's important for teams to arrive at the staging area *before* they are meant to put the robot in the arena. Shepherds are volunteers who speak to teams and tell them when they should have left for their match to make it safely on time.

There's also a 'head shepherd' who handles communicating delays, schedule changes, and team swaps to the shepherds.

## In Detail


### Shepherds

Generally we have at least one shepherd per arena. To make it easier over radio, shepherds should be assigned a colour. Each shepherd gets a print-out of the schedule for the teams they are meant to call down, and when they should be called down.

There should be a radio link between all shepherds to confirm teams are on their way, and communicate any delays.

During the finals, the competition is in knock-out mode. Meaning in worst case the teams for the next match are only known immediately after the end of the match, so shepherds will be told what teams they are to find over the radio.

### Head Shepherd

The Head shepherd has their own competition screen with the match times, staging area closing times, and call-down times. They are to announce over the radio which match number it is, and when to start calling teams down.

In venues such as newbury racecourse, when teams are split between floors, the shepherd for higher floors should be told to send their teams down earlier than shepherds on the ground floor.

Depending on the venue, teams may move from their pits to a larger area to test in. All shepherds should note this down and keep track of it.
